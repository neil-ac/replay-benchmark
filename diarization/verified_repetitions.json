The repetition could also be a rhetorical device, where the speaker is using repetition to create emphasis or to draw attention to a particular idea. However, it's important to note that the context provided is quite brief and does not give a clear indication of the speaker's intent. The repetition could also be a sign of hesitation or stuttering, but the speaker's tone and the lack of additional context make it difficult to determine this.\n\nRESULT: natural"
